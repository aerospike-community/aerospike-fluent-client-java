/**
 * Factory interface for providing record mappers that convert between Aerospike records
 * and Java objects.
 * 
 * <p>This interface defines a factory pattern for obtaining {@link RecordMapper} instances
 * that can handle the serialization and deserialization of Java objects to and from
 * Aerospike records. This enables automatic object mapping when working with typed datasets.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The factory is typically set on a {@link Cluster} instance and is used by the
 * client to automatically find appropriate mappers for different object types.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example implementation:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyRecordMappingFactory implements RecordMappingFactory {
 *     private final Map<Class<?>, RecordMapper<?>> mappers = new HashMap<>();
 *     
 *     public MyRecordMappingFactory() {
 *         mappers.put(Customer.class, new CustomerMapper());
 *         mappers.put(Address.class, new AddressMapper());
 *     }
 *     
 *     @Override
 *     public <T> RecordMapper<T> getMapper(Class<T> clazz) {
 *         return (RecordMapper<T>) mappers.get(clazz);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>

 * @see DefaultRecordMappingFactory
